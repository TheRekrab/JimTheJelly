# Jim The Jelly

My first attempt at a PyGame game in Python.

## Running

To run the script, simply use Python:
```
$ python game.py
```

If you run the script through the command line, you will see updates about the game, such as when it starts, the FPS, and when/why it closes.

## How to play

Upon opening, the window will show a bubbly background with a "Jellyfish" in the corner. User the WASD or arrow keys to move Jim around the screen, collecting coins. Your current coin count will be stored in the top-left corner.
